# Hashtags_Prediction

## Features
  * Cleaning dataset
  * Extract dataset from large stream file
  * Train a DNN neural network (model)
  * Predict hashtags with trained models

## Dataset description:

The dataset is compose of more than 2M tweets.
```
Tweets are json object separated by '\n'
```

### Data look like
```json
{"text": "The Evolution of the             https://t.co/frtmvBHIFdUtarSystems", "hashtags": ["IoT", "BigData", "DataScience", "Chatbot", "9and9", "Fintech", "Insurtech", "AI", "VR", "AR", "Startup"]}
{"text": "Follow the tips bellow and you could be on your way to win 20k monthly cc  @HHappyfish @busolaholloway  https://t.co/pxiGlNaJ44", "hashtags": ["OnlineHype"]}
```
>Hashtags has already been removed from text !
